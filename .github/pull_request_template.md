## Steps to Creating a Pull Request
* Assign yourself as the **Assignee**
* Allow one of the Code Owners/Maintainers review the changes proposed by the Pull Request.
* Provide appropriate labels as necessary

> [!TIP]
> `enchancement` for new features, `documentation` for modifications to the docs, `performance` for performance related changes, and so on.

* Provide a description of the work that has been done.
    * It is nice to know what was added, removed, modified, and with screenshots of those changes.

> [!TIP]
> You can have them under **Added**, **Removed**, **Updates**, and **Screenshots** if any (**Changes** could also be used).

## After the Pull Request is Opened
* One the Pull Request has been created, please add any Issue(s) that are being addressed by this change (if any).
* If the reviewer(s) mention any changes or open threads for questions, please resolve those as soon as you can.
